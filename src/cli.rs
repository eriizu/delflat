Copy given files from a root directory structure to a destination directory, filing everything under one subdirectory level.

Running with flags '--root ./root --dest ./dest **/*.txt' and this dir structure:
- ./root/
  - subdir_a/
    - foo.txt
    - subdir_ab/
      - tata.txt
      - toto.txt
  - subdir_b/
    - tata.txt
    - subdir_bb/
      - toto.txt

will produce:
- ./dest/
  - subdir_a/
    - foo.txt
    - toto.txt
    - tata.txt
  - subdir_b/
    - tata.txt
    - toto.txt

In case of conflicting file names, run with -k. With the same root as above, produces:
- ./dest/
  - subdir_a/
    - foo.txt
    - subdir_ab.toto.txt
    - subdir_ab.tata.txt
  - subdir_b/
    - tata.txt
    - toto.txt";
